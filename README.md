# nivo-boilerplate
just basic responsive bar with nivo as a starter, to be able to graph with mostly python and just a reduced amount of javascript. There is no getting started guide on nivo unfortunately.

To run the code you can clone the repo and you need to install the dependencies
You can use 
```npm install```
and then
```npm start```
and it should start the server locally, available at localhost:3000

The code is also available in a sandbox: --> [sandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/s/nivo-basic-demo-forked-zr2i4) <--
